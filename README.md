# Applied-Math

This repository contains various math projects that have been done in both Matlab and Python. 

The python scripts are used for my number analysis. I partition numbers into segments and then use the Google Sheets API to analyze the number distributions in Google Sheets. Specifically, this is normally done in 6n segments with a focus on 24 segmented rings. The code is not optimized for speed, however. More work is being done here. 


The next set of prorgams are Matlab files that model fractal set variations (including Mandelbrot and Julia), cellular automata, and chaotic mathematical behavior. The write-ups are certainly not my cleanest, but they are there nonetheless.
